## Description

This project is a dynamic e-commerce store developed using React with Vite and TypeScript, showcasing a modern, responsive design styled with styled-components. It features a robust e-commerce functionality set, including product listings, an advanced cart system, checkout process, and contact form validation.

## Features

- **Dynamic Product Listings**: Products are fetched from an API and displayed on the homepage. Each product card is clickable, leading to a detailed product page.
- **Lookahead Search Functionality**: A responsive search bar on the homepage filters products dynamically as the user types, enhancing the shopping experience.
- **Individual Product Pages**: Detailed pages for each product, displaying images, descriptions, prices, discounts, and customer reviews.
- **Cart System**: Users can add products to their cart, with the cart icon updating in real time to show the current item count.
- **Checkout Process**: A checkout page lists all items in the cart, provides a total price, and leads to a checkout success page upon completion.
- **Contact Page**: Features a form with validation for user inputs such as name, subject, email, and message body.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted using styled-components to ensure the application is fully responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
- **React Router**: Utilizes React Router for efficient page navigation and dynamic routing.
